A new Flutter project.

In the post-COVID-19 era where people have to stay at home and work from home, the
desire to travel and explore has increased. If people want to choose a travel destination, they
need to gather information about that place. Currently, searching for information on websites
on computers is not difficult, but using websites on mobile phones may not provide the best
user experience. Therefore, using mobile applications for information search can be another
option that may provide a better user experience. In particular, there are not many mobile
applications that categorize travel destinations based on their locations in Thailand. This serves
as the motivation and inspiration for creating a location-based category search application by
the team of developers.
